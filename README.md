GUI Testing repository to automate Trello features.

## Branch's name format

The format for the names of each branch is "feature/name"
example:

```
$ feature/users
$ bug/<bug_name>
$ hotfix/<what_are_you_fixing>
```

## Setup

To run this project, install it locally using npm:

```
$ npm install
```

## ESLint

We are using EcmaScript 6.

How to use in your code:

```
$ npm run lint
$ npm run lint:fix
```

The second command will fix the code automatic. But you need to consider that some errors should be fixed manually.
